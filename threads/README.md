## Threads
In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.

## Processes vs Threads
It is true that processes and threads share many similar concepts but differ in some perspectives.
- Processes are typically independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process
- Processes carry considerably more state information than threads, whereas multiple threads within a process share process state as well as memory and other resources
- Processes have separate address spaces, whereas threads share their address space
- Processes interact only through system-provided inter-process communication mechanisms
- Context switching between threads in the same process typically occurs faster than context switching between processes
